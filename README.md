## Project Overview  
This is a web-based **Weather App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Webpack**. The app provides users with real-time weather data including today's forecast, hourly forecast, 5-day forecast, wind speed, pressure, UV light levels, and humidity. This project was developed as part of **The Odin Project's** curriculum.

## Features  
This weather app includes the following features:
- **Search by City:** Enter any city name to retrieve weather data.
- **Today's Forecast:** Displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and more.
- **Hourly Forecast:** Shows hourly weather predictions for the upcoming hours.
- **5-Day Forecast:** Displays weather predictions for the next 5 days.
- **Wind Speed & Pressure:** View the current wind speed and atmospheric pressure.
- **UV Light & Humidity:** Get real-time data on UV light levels and humidity.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** ‚Äì For the structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS** ‚Äì For styling the app.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì To fetch and display real-time weather data using a weather API.
- **Webpack** ‚Äì For bundling and optimizing JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, ensuring better performance.
- **VirtualCrossing API** ‚Äì To retrieve live weather data based on user input.
- **API Handling** ‚Äì Uses JavaScript to interact with the weather API and display data dynamically.
